# Predicting Airline Passenger Satisfaction with Classification and Clustering

## Description

Applying a variety of classification and clustering techniques on an extensive mixed US airline dataset, our research analyzes satisfaction with the airlineâ€™s services in a unique combined approach to this problem. This project contains SVM (support vector machine), logistic regression and decision tree classification models. 

The overall objectives of this work were to create a high efficiency predictive classification model and to identify the most important contributors to customer satisfaction and also to discover customer groups and their common traits to better target satisfaction improvement measures.
